## Intermediate Concepts and Best Practices in Python
Basic syntax, data types, common in-built data structures (strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries), control flow methods (loops, conditionals, and functions), or importing modules (*.py files) probably donâ€™t need any special demonstration. More  advanced concepts like object-oriented programming (including classes, instances and methods, data abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, discussion of the OOP vs functional programming, etc), exception handling, file handling,  lambda functions (especially in list comprehension and for pandas series), generators, regular expressions, maps, collections, decorators will be demonstrated in this repo.
